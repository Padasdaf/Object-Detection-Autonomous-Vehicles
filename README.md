# Object-Detection-Autonomous-Vehicles
This is the source code and documentation for an object detection program designed for autonomous vehicles I helped to make along with peers and industry mentors at Inspirit AI! The focus was on effectively harnessing the Darknet architecture of YOLO, which along with utilizing the libraries of TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, achieved a 0.99 confidence score. The program leverages these advanced machine learning techniques to identify and classify various objects on the road, ensuring safe and efficient navigation.
